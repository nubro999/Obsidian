Think about this for a moment - right now, millions of laptops and personal computers around the world are sitting idle, using only a fraction of their computing power. Meanwhile, developers and businesses are paying enormous costs for centralized cloud services that often face reliability issues and vendor lock-in problems.

DAAS-VADER solves this by creating a peer-to-peer computing network where SUI powers the entire ecosystem. SUI serves as our native currency for staking, payments for computing resources, and automated rewards distribution, while our smart contracts handle trustless escrow and TEE-verified result validation.

"Here's the problem: Companies spend billions on cloud resources while millions of personal computers sit idle, wasting 60-80% of their computing power. This creates a massive barrier for smaller developers who can't afford expensive infrastructure.

We have abundant unused resources on one side, and innovation being limited by high costs on the other. That's exactly what DAAS-VADER fixes."
다음

"DAAS-VADER flips the cloud model completely. Instead of centralized data centers, personal computers provide computing resources while blockchain handles orchestration and trust verification on-chain.

Our Sui smart contracts manage everything - resource allocation, payments, and reputation systems. Resource providers stake SUI tokens as proof-of-stake for quality assurance, while consumers pay with SUI for actual resource consumption.

We integrate four powerful technologies: Kubernetes orchestrates containers across distributed nodes, Walrus provides decentralized storage, Seal handles secure authentication, and Nautilus ensures tamper-proof execution through TEE-based verification. for now, sui network and backend server substitute controlplain by event driven method. we will change backend to nautilus to aquire complete security

This is the complete process we are envisioning.

This is our currently implemented demo project. We have separated the functions of the existing Kubernetes master node and worker nodes, placing the master node in the backend and creating an environment where resource providers can run only worker nodes.

Our vision is simple but transformative Making every computer a cloud provider, every developer a cloud consumer, and every application truly decentralized.

When that time comes, someone will say "I am your program."

- 84% of organizations struggle with managing cloud spend as their biggest challenge [Enterprise cloud computing challenges 2024 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/511283/worldwide-survey-cloud-computing-risks/)
- High unavailability of cloud services and lack of reliability are major concerns [Top 15 Cloud Computing Challenges of 2025 [with Solutions]](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/cloud-computing/cloud-computing-challenges)
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Difficult and costly to switch providers due to proprietary technologies
- **Resource Wastage**: Personal computers sit idle 60-80% of the time while cloud costs skyrocket

**The Paradox:**

- Companies pay $billions for cloud resources
- Meanwhile, millions of personal laptops/PCs remain underutilized
- Centralized cloud providers create single points of failure
- Limited access to computing resources for smaller developers and startups

---

### **3. Personal Computer Resource Waste**

**The Hidden Problem:**

- **Average laptop utilization**: Only 20-40% during work hours
- **Evening/weekend usage**: Nearly 0% for most business laptops
- **Global scale**: Billions of idle CPU cores and RAM going unused
- **Environmental impact**: Wasted electricity and hardware depreciation

**Current Reality:**

- Small developers can't afford AWS/GCP for experimentation
- Kubernetes learning curve is high due to infrastructure costs
- Innovation is limited by access to computing resources
- Geographic limitations in cloud provider availability

2. **Cryptographic Verification**: TEE generates attestation proving execution integrity [Nautilus | Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/cryptography/nautilus)
3. **Result Validation**: Smart contracts verify outputs before payment release
4. **Reputation Update**: Both providers and consumers receive reputation updates
