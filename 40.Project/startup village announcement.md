Hello everyone, we're SounDAO. Thanks for being here, let's get started.

have you heard about k-pop demon hunters?
These days, Demon Hunters’ “Golden” is everywhere.
It’s just a soundtrack from a Netflix animation, but it has stayed on the top of Billboard for weeks

So here’s a question: how far do you think that hype will go?
If you could take a long or short position on “Golden,” what would you choose?

if i had a chance, I thought it was overheated, and I would choose short.
And if that product existed, I’d probably be liquidated.

But here’s the point: there is still no legal and transparent way to invest directly in music trends.
That gap is where SoundDAO begins.

A lot of Web3 projects tried to put music on-chain.
Some turned songs into NFTs, some tried to certify copyrights on-chain.
But they all failed to answer one simple question:
“Why put music on-chain?"
SoundDAO gives a clear answer.
We don’t just “upload.”
다음

We manage the full stack — copyright registration, global distribution, revenue collection, and on-chain payouts.
Artists focus on making music.
We handle the messy legal and financial work.

Fans and investors join directly through Song Tokens.
Stake, and you receive real revenue.
다음

Now, the key tool here is tokenization.
Each song becomes a fungible Song Token.
The token carries metadata: cover art, artist and writer credits, genre
The actual audio file is stored in decentralized storage like Pinata on IPFS.
So every token is like an on-chain certificate for the song.

But the real value is this:
When you stake the token, you get a share of all revenue from that track.
Buying the token is not just ownership it’s buying the right to claim its royalties.
다음

Here’s how it works in practice.
When a song is uploaded, we run a fixed-price presale for one week.
Once the funding goal is reached, the Song Token is minted, and a liquidity pool with SOL is created automatically through our own contract.”
The community itself provides liquidity.
다음

Once the presale ends, we move to revenue.
First, we register the copyright in the United States.
Because Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube all run through the U.S. market.

Then we use professional distributors to push the track to global digital streaming platforms by our SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)

Then the system distributes royalties to Song Token stakers.
다음

and this is potion of our tokenomics
token consists of presale, liquidity, marketing and artists
다음

And why Solana?
Because we need payouts that are frequent, broad, and cheap.
And Solana has a standard called Token-2022 we use lock function.

let me show some demo
“This is our main page.
At first glance, it looks like YouTube Music or Spotify.
다음
“Next, we have the launchpad dashboard.
This page shows all the songs that are currently in presale,
다음
“After presale ends, the song becomes officially tokenized.
On this page, you’ll see its chart and trading functions.
다음

So let me wrap this up.
SoundDAO is not another music NFT project.
We are building a cash-flowing music RWA infrastructure.
We register the rights, we collect the revenue, and we distribute it fairly to artists and stakers.

The better the music performs, the more value flows back into the system.
Don’t stop at listening.
If you believe in your taste, participate, stake, and share the results.

Your Playlist, Your Portfolio.

That's our project. Thank you for your attention, and we're happy to take any questions.
